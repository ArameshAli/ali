Film capacitors are critical components in high-reliability circuits. Their failure mechanisms can vary based on manufacturing quality, operating environment, and circuit design.

## 🔧 Common Failure Mechanisms in Film Capacitors

1. **Self-Healing Breakdown**  
   The metallized layer burns away at the fault site, isolating the defect. This prevents catastrophic failure but reduces capacitance over time.

2. **Delamination**  
   Separation between film layers, often triggered by poor adhesion or high thermal cycling, leading to increased ESR and eventual open circuit.

3. **Moisture Ingress**  
   Environmental humidity can penetrate non-hermetically sealed capacitors, resulting in insulation degradation or corrosion.

4. **End Spray Defects**  
   Poor contact at the end spray can lead to intermittent disconnection and arcing.

## 🔍 Self-Healing Explained

Film capacitors often use **metallized film**, which is designed to evaporate locally when a fault occurs. This process is known as **self-healing**.

### Benefits:
- Prevents short circuits
- Allows capacitor to continue operating after small faults
- Extends operational lifetime in moderate stress conditions

### Drawbacks:
- Gradual loss of capacitance
- Limited number of self-healing events per capacitor

## 🛠 Field Observations

While working with **Hitachi Energy**, I evaluated several failed film capacitors under:

- Thermal aging tests
- Overvoltage conditions
- Micro-sectioning for failure localization

Failures were mapped, and RCA reports were generated recommending better film segmentation and moisture-resistant packaging.

## 🔍 Bad segmentation

Because you might put code in your blog post, and you want to make sure it will look good in here. Plus that the search
function will still be working!

## 🔍 Oil leakage

during the process of metalization, the oil injection on the surface of the mtalized film capacitors can be problematic, and lead to short circuit.
