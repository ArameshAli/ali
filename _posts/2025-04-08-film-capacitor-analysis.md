Film capacitors are widely used in power electronics due to their reliability and low ESR. However, when exposed to high temperatures and humidity, they may fail due to insulation breakdown, moisture ingress, or internal delamination.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

While working at **Hitachi Energy**, I led the investigation of multiple capacitor failures under accelerated aging tests. The process involved:

- Thermal profiling
- DC leakage current tests
- Metallised film dissection
- Failure mode classification
